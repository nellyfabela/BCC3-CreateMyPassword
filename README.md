# Bootcamp Challenge 03 - Nelly Fabela

## Description

This challenge allowed me to dig deeper in the realistic knowledge I have of all the previous challenges. Using JavaScript has been interesting since I've had to do more research on my own for the topic and finding out the different ways things can get done has helped me to have a wider knowledge on the topic. The activity was pretty challenging for me and made me again have to take close look at the details from the code, knowing that just one character can make the whole "function" disappear, so I think it also makes it very impressive that one small thing can make a big impact on the nig picture.

## Installation

For this Challenge I used mainly GitHub, VS Code and an internet browser. 

## User Story

The challenge indicates the desires to accomplish:
```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Usage

The website must look like this in order to accomplish the Acceptance Criteria and as well prompts must appear at the top considering what we need for the password being generated:
